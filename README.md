# Machine Learning

In this repository the routines will be uploaded using python and Tensorflow.

Current files:

  - Linear regression: performs a simple regression routine that allows to predict value given a previously known training set.
  - Image recognition: trains and evaluates a large dataset 10 classes of 28px x 28px grayscale pictures. Different callbacks are used.
  - Image classification: trains the algorithm so that images can be classified according to a binary set of classes. This code requires the module wget to retrieve dataset. 
  - Transfer learning: routine that uses the inception_v3 function to load pretrained weights and carry them to an image classification problem.
